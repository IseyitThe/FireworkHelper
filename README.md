Firework Helper Mod for Minecraft

Firework Helper is a simple yet useful mod that lets you use firework rockets with a custom keybind, making Elytra flying much easier and smoother. Instead of having to manually select and use rockets from your hotbar, you can just press a key and the mod will automatically launch a rocket from your inventory.
